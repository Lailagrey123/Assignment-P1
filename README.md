#Assignment P1-First GUI Development Project
#Graph User Interface Dev

#The developement tool that I used is Python Tkinter which is built in within Python.
#Some issues that I ran into this project what getting the font size and color code correct, and I also struggled with getting the program to exit; I got some help from stack overflow. Creating the objects waere easy because that was given to us in the project sheet instructions. This was not as hard as I thought it would be; listening to the lecture and some youtube videos helped me alot.
